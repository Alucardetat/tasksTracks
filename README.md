# TaskTracks

Task Tracker is a simple task management application that allows users to create, update, delete, and track their tasks. Designed with flexibility in mind, Task Tracker supports both personal task management and team collaboration, with planned features to expand functionality further.

## Features

### Current Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks.


### Planned Features
- **Task Categorization**: Organize tasks based on categories or priorities.
- **User Authentication**: Basic user authentication to manage personal tasks.
- **Team Collaboration**: Share tasks and responsibilities with team members for larger projects.
- **Task History Tracking**: View task history statistics, including:
  - Tasks completed on time.
  - Tasks completed late.
  - Uncompleted tasks.
  - Postponed tasks.
  - Tasks canceled by the organizer (won't affect user metrics).
- **Graphical Insights**:
  - Personal task metrics (individual performance).
  - Team task metrics (collaborative performance without overshadowing personal metrics).

## Tech Stack
**To demomstrate CRUD I used the following:**
- **M**ongoDB: The NoSQL database used to store and manage application data in a flexible, schema-less format.
- **E**xpress.js: The lightweight and robust Node.js framework, designed for building fast, scalable APIs and server-side logic.
- **R**eact: The powerful front-end JavaScript library used to create dynamic user interfaces and handle client-side interactions.
- **N**ode.js: The high-performance, event-driven runtime environment that powers the server and facilitates seamless JavaScript execution across the stack.

##
- **Version Control**: GitHub, you silly.
