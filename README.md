### Planned Features

- **User Authentication**: Basic user authentication to manage personal tasks.

  - Tasks completed on time.
  - Tasks completed late.
  - Uncompleted tasks.
  - Postponed tasks.
  - Tasks canceled by the organizer (won't affect user metrics).
- **Graphical Insights**:
  - Personal task metrics (individual performance).
  - Team task metrics (collaborative performance without overshadowing personal metrics).
